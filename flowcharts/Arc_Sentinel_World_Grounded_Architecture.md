# Arc Sentinel: World-Grounded Architecture

![Arc Sentinel Diagram](./Arc_Sentinel_World_Grounded_Architecture.png)

This systems diagram illustrates how Arc Sentinel extends a text-only language model
into a world-grounded safety architecture:

- **Reflective Duality Layer (RDL)** and **Reflective Alignment Architecture (RAA)**
  stabilize internal reasoning before any world interaction.

- **RID-E Ecological Grounding** injects real-time Earth signals to anchor the model in
  physical consequences, ecological dynamics, and uncertainty calibration.

- **ARC Sentinel Agents** perform continuous monitoring of hazards, cascading risks,
  and real-world signals that a text-only model would otherwise be blind to.

The architecture demonstrates how reflective reasoning and ecological grounding
combine to produce a model that is *situationally aware*, *risk-calibrated*, and
capable of long-horizon stability.
