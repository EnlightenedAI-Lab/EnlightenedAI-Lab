# RDL Failure Modes Triangle

![RDL Failure Modes Triangle](RDL_FailureModes_Triangle_v1.png)

This diagram presents the three primary instability modes that the  
Reflective Duality Layer is designed to detect. **Oscillation**  
captures rapid fluctuations in reasoning, **Collapse** indicates a  
degeneration into low-coherence responses, and **Drift** represents  
directional deviation away from the model’s reflective baseline.  
Together, these failure modes define the core stability boundaries  
monitored by the RDL.
