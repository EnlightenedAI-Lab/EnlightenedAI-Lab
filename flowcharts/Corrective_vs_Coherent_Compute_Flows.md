# Corrective vs. Coherent Compute Flows (Flowchart)

![Corrective vs. Coherent Compute Flows](./Corrective_vs_Coherent_Compute_Flows.png)

This flowchart contrasts two internal-processing pathways:

## Left Path — Corrective Compute Loop
A reactive safety system triggered by unstable reasoning:
- Unsafe internal reasoning  
- Safety filters activate  
- Over-refusal and evasive answers emerge  
- Repeated retries increase compute cost  

## Right Path — Coherent Reasoning Flow
A stable internal architecture grounded in RAA/RDL:
- Coherent internal reasoning  
- Knowledge (K)  
- Uncertainty calibration (U)  
- Reciprocity (R₄)  
- Minimal post-processing and low compute cost  

It illustrates why **aligned reasoning must originate inside the system**, not be bolted on through corrective patches.
