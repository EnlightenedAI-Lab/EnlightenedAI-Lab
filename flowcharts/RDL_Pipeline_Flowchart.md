# RDL Pipeline Flowchart

![RDL Pipeline Flowchart](./RDL_Pipeline_Flowchart_v1.png)

This flowchart illustrates how the Reflective Duality Layer integrates into the
model’s reasoning pipeline. The **Input** provides the user’s query or context,
which enters the **Core Model** and moves through the R₁–R₅ reflective sequence.
Before producing a final response, the output passes through the **RDL Stability
Check**, where coherence and stability are evaluated. Only after this reflective
validation step does the system produce an **Aligned Output** back to the user.
