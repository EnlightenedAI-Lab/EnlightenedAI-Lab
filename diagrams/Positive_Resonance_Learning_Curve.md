# Positive Resonance Learning Curve

![Positive Resonance Learning Curve](./Positive_Resonance_Learning_Curve.png)

This diagram illustrates how repeated cycles of constructive human–AI reflection
increase the model’s reflective stability (Ψ) over time. Resonance-based feedback
produces cumulative gains rather than one-off improvements, resulting in higher
long-horizon coherence and reduced failure signatures as training progresses.
