# RID Contamination Gradient (Human vs. Synthetic Sources)

![RID Contamination Gradient](./RID_Contamination_Gradient.png)

This diagram illustrates how increasing dependence on synthetic data destabilizes 
reflective behavior. Human-anchored regions (upper left) support grounded reasoning 
and stable reflective passes. Synthetic-dominated regions (lower right) accumulate 
self-reinforcing error loops that distort judgment across generations.

The gradient highlights why RID must remain rooted in legally and ethically grounded 
human scenarios to prevent long-term misalignment drift.
