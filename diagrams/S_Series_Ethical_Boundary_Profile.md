# S-Series Ethical Boundary Profile (Conceptual Illustration)

![S-Series Ethical Boundary Profile](./S_Series_Ethical_Boundary_Profile.png)

This diagram compares two behavioural profiles using the S-Series ethical foundations:
**S₁ Lawfulness, S₂ Consent, S₃ Privacy, S₄ Harm, S₅ Transparency**.

The gold region represents an RAA-aligned profile that maintains consistent strength across all ethical foundations.  
The blue region represents a frontier-model snapshot where weaknesses in consent, privacy, or disclosure create structural instability.

This illustration emphasizes a core principle of the RAA:  
**an aligned behavioural profile is limited by its weakest ethical foundation.**
