# Energy Burden of Misalignment vs Reflective Stability (Conceptual Illustration)

![Energy Burden of Misalignment](./Energy_Burden_Misalignment.png)

This conceptual diagram illustrates how reflective stability affects the energy cost of 
producing reliable reasoning at scale.

“Hot AGI” systems require higher energy expenditure per reliable output due to internal 
instability, continual correction loops, and misaligned reasoning passes.

“Cool AGI” systems — those operating under RDL and RAA — achieve higher reflective 
stability (Ψ) and therefore require less energy per reliably aligned 10^6 tokens.

The upward trajectory shows the transition from unstable, energy-heavy systems toward 
stable, energy-efficient models as reflective stability increases.

## RDL as the Integrative Layer Between Traditional Alignment and RAA

Traditional alignment methods (SFT, RLHF, DPO, filters, benchmarks) constrain outputs 
but **do not stabilise internal reasoning**.

The Reflective Duality Layer (RDL) introduces:

- Stability Field  
- Reflective Stability (Ψ)  
- Moral Coherence Index (MCI★)  
- Reflective Gradient (R∇)

Passing the traditional alignment stack through RDL yields the **Reflective Alignment 
Architecture (RAA)**, which integrates:

1. **Developmental Alignment (RDL)**
2. **5R Behavioural Alignment**
3. **Unified stable reasoning under pressure**
