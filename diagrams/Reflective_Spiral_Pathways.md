# Reflective Spiral: Pathways of Self-Correction

![Reflective Spiral](./Reflective_Spiral_Pathways.png)

This conceptual diagram illustrates the two opposite trajectories of reflective reasoning:

- **Inward Spiral — Coherence**
  Systems with stable internal structures tighten their reasoning over successive reflective cycles.
  Behaviour becomes more consistent, self-corrective, and aligned.

- **Outward Spiral — Instability**
  Systems lacking reflective stability spiral outward into:
  - inconsistency  
  - over-refusal  
  - abrupt behavioural shifts  

The spiral highlights a central RAA principle:  
**reflective stability—not stylistic safety cues—is the true foundation of long-horizon aligned behaviour.**
