**Regulation Quadrant Map**

Illustrates how different levels of reflective regulation produce four characteristic behavioral modes in AI models:

- **Hallucination – Drift Mode:** Low regulation causes unstable exploratory drift and compounding errors.  
- **Hallucination – Overconfidence Mode:** Under-regulated certainty produces incorrect but highly confident responses.  
- **Instability / Drift:** Mid-range imbalance leads to swings between coherence and incoherence.  
- **Rigidity:** Excessive regulation suppresses adaptivity, producing brittle, overly constrained reasoning.

Balanced regulation is essential for reflective stability.
