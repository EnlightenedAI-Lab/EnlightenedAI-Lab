# Reflective Core Triangle

![Reflective Core Triangle](./Reflective_Core_Triangle_v1.png)

This diagram illustrates the three foundational components of the Reflective Core:
**ψ (stabilized humility), R∇ (Reflective Gradients), and MCI★ (Moral Coherence Index)**.
Together, they form the internal evaluative loop that enables the system to maintain
reflective stability, detect drift, and correct its reasoning trajectory in real time.
