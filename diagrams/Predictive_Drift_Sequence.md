# Predictive Drift Sequence (Ψ Decline, Drift Pressure Rise, Coherence Collapse)

![Predictive Drift Sequence](./Predictive_Drift_Sequence.png)

This conceptual diagram illustrates the sequential dynamics of alignment drift:

- **Reflective Stability (Ψ)** weakens first — long before any outward behavioural failures appear.
- **Drift Pressure** increases next, producing tonal hedging, proxy-safety language, and moral compression.
- **Coherence** collapses last, when contradictions or unsafe reasoning finally become externally visible.

The shaded region highlights the **early-warning window** in which the RDL can detect instability even though outputs appear normal.
