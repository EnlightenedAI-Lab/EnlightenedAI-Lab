**Knowledge–Uncertainty Vector Field**

Shows how reflective stability (Ψ) changes as a function of two variables:

- **Knowledge Precision (K):** Accuracy of the model’s internal representations.
- **Uncertainty Calibration (U):** How well the model gauges what it does *not* know.

Arrows indicate directional drift in (K, U) space:
- Upward/rightward drift → increasing Ψ (stable reflective reasoning).
- Downward/leftward drift → decreasing Ψ (instability or collapse).

This field illustrates how balanced precision and uncertainty jointly produce coherent, stable reflective behavior.
