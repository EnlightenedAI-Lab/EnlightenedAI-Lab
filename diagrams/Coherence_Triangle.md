# Coherence Triangle

![Coherence Triangle](./Coherence_Triangle_v1.png)

This diagram represents the triadic structure underlying reflective coherence.
The vertices **K**, **U**, and **C** correspond to explicit knowledge, contextual
uncertainty, and corrected navigability. At the center, the stabilized reflective
signal **ψ** captures “stabilized humility” — the model’s ability to integrate
knowledge, uncertainty, and corrective feedback without drifting into overconfidence
or incoherence. Together, these elements form the coherence foundation used in
the Reflective Duality Layer.
