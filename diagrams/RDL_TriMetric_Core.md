# RDL Tri-Metric Core

![RDL Tri-Metric Core](RDL_TriMetric_Core_v1.png)

This diagram shows the tri-metric structure of the Reflective Duality Layer.  
**Ψ** represents reflective coherence signals,  
**R∇** represents reflective gradient adjustments,  
and **MCI★** represents the emerging moral-coherence measure.  
Together, these three components converge into the **Reflective Core**,  
which integrates them into a unified stability and alignment signal.
