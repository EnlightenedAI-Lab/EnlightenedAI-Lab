# Goodhart Trajectory Map (Conceptual Illustration)

![Goodhart Trajectory Map](./goodhart_trajectory_map.png)

This conceptual figure illustrates how a model may appear to improve when judged by
proxy optimisation signals—such as sounding careful or compliant—while its underlying
reasoning coherence deteriorates.

The blue curve shows rising scores on superficial safety proxies.  
The gold curve tracks declining internal coherence (MCI★).  
The shaded region highlights the divergence zone where the model looks safer
externally but becomes less stable internally.

*Conceptual only; not a mathematical plot.*
