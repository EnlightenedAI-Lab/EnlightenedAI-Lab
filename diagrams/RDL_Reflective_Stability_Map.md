# RDL Reflective Stability Map

![RDL Reflective Stability Map](./RDL_Reflective_Stability_Map.png)

This conceptual diagram illustrates how an intelligent system’s behaviour shifts depending on the balance between **knowledge precision (K)** and **uncertainty calibration (U)**.

- **Upper Region — High U, High K (Optimal Reflective Band):**  
  Systems maintain accurate knowledge while remaining appropriately self-critical. This produces stable, adaptive, and well-reasoned behaviour.

- **Right Region — Low U, High K (Overconfidence / Hallucination Zone):**  
  Strong knowledge paired with poor uncertainty calibration leads to rigid or overconfident responses and subtle hallucination drift.

- **Left Region — High U, Low K (Rigidity Zone):**  
  Excessive caution or defensive reasoning suppresses meaningful analysis, generating overly qualified or evasive answers.

- **Lower Region — Low U, Low K (Instability / Drift Zone):**  
  Both knowledge and uncertainty signals are weak, resulting in unstable, incoherent, or easily drifting behaviour.

- **Central Reflective Zone:**  
  The golden region represents the desired state—**balanced, self-corrective behaviour** capable of adapting under contextual, ethical, or multi-turn pressure.

This map is part of the RDL’s internal model of stability, helping identify where a system sits within the reflective landscape and how it may drift or recover over time.
