# Alignment–Cost Frontier (Conceptual Illustration)

![Alignment–Cost Frontier](./Alignment_Cost_Frontier.png)

This conceptual diagram shows how reflective stability (Ψ) scales with capability under
different training regimes.

Misaligned training paths require continual retraining, patching, and overrides to keep the
system safe, resulting in higher cumulative cost for each increase in capability.

The RDL-stabilized path demonstrates how reflective stability reduces long-term correction
and oversight load, enabling capability to increase without proportional alignment cost.

Iso-cost curves illustrate the efficiency gap:  
**RDL-stabilized systems reach higher stability at lower total correction cost.**
