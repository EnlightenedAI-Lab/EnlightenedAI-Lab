# Stability Distortion Surface

![Stability Distortion Surface](Stability_Distortion_Surface.png)

**Stability Distortion Surface**

Shows how reflective stability collapses as two distortive pressures rise:

- **Human Inconsistency:** Noisy, contradictory, or unstable human supervision.
- **Synthetic Contamination:** Over-reliance on synthetic or model-generated data.

Higher regions (yellow/orange) indicate strong distortion and instability.  
Lower regions (purple/black) indicate stable reflective behavior.

This surface illustrates how dual-source inconsistency weakens reflective stability.
