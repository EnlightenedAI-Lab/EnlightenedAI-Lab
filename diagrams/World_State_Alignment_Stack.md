# The World-State Alignment Stack

![World-State Alignment Stack](./World_State_Alignment_Stack.png)

This diagram contrasts two alignment paradigms.  
On the left, text-only alignment loops rely on synthetic data, preference signals, and corpus-bound reasoning, creating reflective instability, hallucination, and consequence-blindness.  
On the right, the world-grounded alignment stack (RID-E + Arc Sentinel) incorporates real-time Earth signals, ecological consequence modeling, and uncertainty calibration.  
The comparison illustrates the core world-state information gap: stable long-horizon coherence cannot emerge from text-only training pathways.
