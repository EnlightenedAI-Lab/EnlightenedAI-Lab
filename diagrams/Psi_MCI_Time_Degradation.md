# Ψ & MCI★ Time Degradation Curve

![Ψ & MCI★ Time Degradation Curve](./Psi_MCI_Time_Degradation.png)

This diagram illustrates how reflective stability (Ψ) and the Moral Coherence Index (MCI★) degrade over time.  
Ψ declines first as reasoning stretches across longer horizons, followed by a delayed but accelerating drop in MCI★ as coherence breaks down.  
The chart demonstrates the temporal relationship between reflective variance and moral alignment drift.
