# R₁–R₅ Stability Interaction Diagram

![R₁–R₅ Stability Interaction Diagram](./R_Stability_Interaction_Diagram.png)

This diagram illustrates how the five behavioral alignment forces—Regulation (R₁),
Reflection (R₂), Reasoning (R₃), Reciprocity (R₄), and Resonance (R₅)—combine to
shape the system’s overall stability profile (Ψ). 
Positive forces reinforce coherent behavior, while negative forces introduce
gradient conflicts that can lead to instability, drift, or collapse during
multi-turn reasoning.
