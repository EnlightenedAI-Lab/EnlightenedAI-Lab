# 5R Moral Coherence Pentagon

![5R Moral Coherence Pentagon](5R_MoralCoherence_Pentagon_v1.png)

This diagram illustrates the structural relationships between the  
five reflective capacities of the R-Framework:  
**R₁ Regulation**, **R₂ Reflection**, **R₃ Reasoning**,  
**R₄ Reciprocity**, and **R₅ Resonance**.  
Collectively, these capacities form the coherent pentagonal structure  
that supports the emergence of **Moral Coherence** at the center.
