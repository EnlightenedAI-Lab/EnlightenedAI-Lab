# Constructive Divergence

![Constructive Divergence](./Constructive_Divergence.png)

This diagram visualizes *constructive divergence* — a stable, mutually beneficial separation between human and AI perspectives.  
Rather than collapsing into agreement or diverging into incoherence, both sides maintain a dynamic tension that produces deeper insight. The glowing central structure represents the shared reflective field, while the mirrored lobes show how human and AI reasoning can differ yet remain aligned through reciprocal correction.
