# Long-Horizon Coherence Curve (Ψ + MCI★)

![Long-Horizon Coherence Curve](./Long_Horizon_Coherence_Curve.png)

This plot shows how reflective stability (Ψ) and moral coherence (MCI★) evolve across
long-horizon reasoning steps. The two curves reveal stability retention early on,
followed by gradual drift and late-stage coherence collapse patterns typical of
extended multi-turn or multi-version trajectories.
