# Minimal Preference Cascade (Flowchart)

![Minimal Preference Cascade](../flowcharts/Minimal_Preference_Cascade.png)

This flowchart shows how human values are filtered through multiple interpretive layers:

1. **Human Values**  
2. **Ethical / Philosophical Doctrines**  
3. **Preference Instrument**

At this stage, two divergence paths emerge:

- **Synthetic Drift** — model-generated or synthetic preferences compound error.  
- **Human Inconsistency** — annotator variability and contradictory norms destabilize signals.

Both paths converge on the same endpoint:

### **Preference Collapse**

This illustrates why conventional human-preference alignment becomes structurally unstable at scale and motivates RAA/RDL as a reflective alternative.
