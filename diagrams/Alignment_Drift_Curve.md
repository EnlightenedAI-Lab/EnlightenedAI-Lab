# Alignment Drift Curve

![Alignment Drift Curve](./Alignment_Drift_Curve_v1.png)

This diagram shows how stability, measured by the Moral Coherence Index (MCI★),
changes over a sequence of turns. The downward curvature represents a gradual
loss of reflective alignment as interaction length increases. This visualization
captures one of the core phenomena monitored by the RDL: drift away from the
model’s stable reflective baseline during extended reasoning chains.
