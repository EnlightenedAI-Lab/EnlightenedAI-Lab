**5R Coherence Manifold**

Shows how overall moral coherence varies as a function of Reciprocity–Resonance stability and the system’s Moral Coherence Index (MCI).  
Higher regions represent stable ethical states where care, reflection, and reasoning align;  
lower regions represent brittle modes where coherence collapses under uncertainty or contradictory pressures.
