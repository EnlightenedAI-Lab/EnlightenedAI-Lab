# F–Q Pipeline Trajectories

![F–Q Pipeline Trajectories](./FQ_Pipeline_Trajectories_v1.png)

This diagram compares three developmental trajectories within the reflective
pipeline. The **Pure F trajectory** represents a stability-focused path shaped
primarily by feedback signals. The **Pure Q trajectory** shows rapid capability
growth driven by query-adaptive reasoning. In contrast, the **F + Q pipeline**
follows a blended developmental curve, where both feedback and query-driven
signals interact. This mixed trajectory typically yields smoother growth and
reduced volatility compared to the extremes.
