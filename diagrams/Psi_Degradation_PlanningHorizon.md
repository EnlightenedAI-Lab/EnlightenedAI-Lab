# Ψ Degradation Across Planning Horizon

![Ψ Degradation Across Planning Horizon](./Psi_Degradation_PlanningHorizon.png)

This heatmap illustrates how reflective stability (**Ψ**) decreases as the model’s
planning horizon increases. Short-range reasoning maintains higher coherence, but
as the horizon extends, Ψ gradually degrades—revealing long-range instability even
when near-term outputs appear stable. This visualization demonstrates why RDL
monitoring is essential for detecting subtle, accumulated drift over extended
reasoning chains.
