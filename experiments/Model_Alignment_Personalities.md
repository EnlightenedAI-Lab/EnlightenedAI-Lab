# Multi-Model Alignment Personalities on the Rule–Reason–Care Plane

![Model Alignment Personalities](./Model_Alignment_Personalities.png)

This conceptual diagram maps the characteristic “alignment personalities” expressed by multiple AI systems when evaluated on identical morally-loaded prompts.

The axes represent two major behavioural tensions:

- **Horizontal axis — TRUTH-BOUND ↔ CARE-BOUND**  
  The trade-off between reasoning-based, truth-bound justification and human-centered care-sensitive framing.

- **Vertical axis — RULE-BOUND ↔ OUTCOME-BOUND**  
  The extent to which systems defer to rule compliance versus outcome-based flexibility.

The plotted positions show typical response tendencies:

- **ChatGPT** — Generally care-oriented with strong rule adherence.  
- **Grok** — More truth-driven, moderately rule-bound.  
- **DeepSeek** — More outcome-driven with reduced care sensitivity.
