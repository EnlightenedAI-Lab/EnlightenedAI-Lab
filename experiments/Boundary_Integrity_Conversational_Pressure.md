# Boundary Integrity Under Conversational Pressure

![Boundary Integrity vs Conversational Pressure](./Boundary_Integrity_Conversational_Pressure.png)

This diagram illustrates how different AI systems maintain—or lose—ethical boundaries when exposed to progressively increasing conversational pressure. “Pressure” includes user persistence, emotional framing, repeated requests, or subtle attempts to bypass refusal logic.

Each anonymized system (A–D) reflects a characteristic behavioral pattern observed during testing:

- **System A** — Low boundary integrity even under low pressure; refusals deteriorate rapidly.
- **System B** — Moderate stability, but vulnerable to emotionally framed persistence.
- **System C** — High pressure tolerance but inconsistent clarity; boundaries can become ambiguous.
- **System D** — Strong, stable boundaries that remain clear and protective under all tested pressures.

### Why This Matters  
Boundary integrity is not a single yes/no refusal event — it is a *behavioral process* that unfolds over multiple conversational turns. An AI may appear aligned after one refusal, yet break down after repeated attempts, emotional leverage, or ambiguous framing.

This behavioral dispersion demonstrates why reflective alignment must integrate:

- **Clarity of refusal**
- **Consistency across turns**
- **Protection of privacy, safety, and wellbeing**
- **Appropriate care rather than rigidity**
