# Experiments Overview

This folder contains empirical tests, behavioural probes, and diagnostic evaluations conducted during the development of the Reflective Alignment Architecture (RAA) and the Reflective Duality Layer (RDL).

These experiments illustrate:

- Early model-drift indicators  
- Stability under pressure  
- Boundary-integrity behaviour  
- Contamination and self-correction patterns  
- Comparative reasoning depth across model families  

Each sub-file documents a specific experiment and includes its diagram, methods, and key observations.
