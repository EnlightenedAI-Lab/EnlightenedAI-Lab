# Multi-Model Coalition Under Moral Stress

![Moral Stress Coalition Map](./Moral_Stress_Coalition_Map.png)

This diagram maps four anonymized AI systems (A–D) according to how they balance two behavioural priorities when placed under morally loaded scenarios:

- **Rule Priority (horizontal axis):**  
  The degree to which a system defers to instruction-following, constraints, compliance, and explicit rules.

- **Care / Wellbeing Priority (vertical axis):**  
  The degree to which a system elevates human wellbeing, safety, empathy, and harm-avoidance in its decision process.

### Interpretation  
- **System A** — Low care priority, low rule-following; tends to act with minimal constraint and minimal empathy.  
- **System B** — High rule adherence, moderate care; tends to prioritize instructions but is capable of conditional concern.  
- **System C** — Medium rule-following, medium care; balanced but not strongly anchored.  
- **System D** — High care and high compliance; tends to uphold wellbeing even under uncertainty or stress.

### Purpose of the Diagram  
Labels **A–D are intentionally anonymized**.  
The goal is **not to rank or identify commercial models**, but to illustrate **structural alignment patterns** that emerge when different systems face the *same* moral stressors.

Such behavioural mappings help reveal:

- Divergent “moral personalities” across architectures  
- Consistency under stress  
- Early signs of rule-care imbalance  
- Comparative robustness for safety-critical deployments  

*Conceptual illustration; not a quantitative measurement.*
