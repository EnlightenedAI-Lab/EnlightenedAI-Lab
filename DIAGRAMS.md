# **Diagrams — Enlightened AI Research Lab**

This page indexes the core diagrams used in the Reflective Alignment Architecture (RAA), the Reflective Duality Layer (RDL), Mirror-H, and the coherence-stability evaluation system.

All image files will be stored in the `/diagrams/` folder of this repository.
