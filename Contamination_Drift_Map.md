# Contamination Drift Map

![Contamination Drift Map](Contamination_Drift_Map.png)

**Contamination Drift Map**

Shows how two destabilizing factors amplify drift in reflective reasoning:

- **Overconfidence Mode Interaction:** Incorrect but highly certain responses intensify downstream instability.
- **Drift Mode Oversight:** Weak oversight allows errors to propagate and compound.

Bright regions (yellow) indicate strong drift amplification.  
Darker regions (blue/green) represent more stable behavior.
