# ENLIGHTENED AI RESEARCH LAB

Advancing scientific frameworks for reflective stability, internal coherence, and moral alignment in frontier AI systems.

Our work focuses on:
- The Reflective Alignment Architecture (RAA)
- The Reflective Duality Layer (RDL)
- Model stability, drift tracking, and reflective coherence
- Evaluation tools for next-generation AI safety

We believe AI systems must demonstrate **stable values, coherent reasoning, and reflective self-correction** before they are trusted in the real world.

## 🔬 Research Focus

### **Reflective Alignment Architecture (RAA)**
A multi-layer framework (L1–L7) designed to measure:
- Internal coherence  
- Value alignment  
- Longitudinal drift  
- Reflective self-correction  
- System-level stability  

### **Reflective Duality Layer (RDL)**
The mathematical core of RAA.  
Compares:
- Forward answer  
- Reflective answer  
- Δ improvement (R∇)  
- Coherence stability (MCI★)  

### **Applied Evaluation Tools**
We develop:
- LLM-Judge (evaluation engine)
- Mirror-H (semantic and interpretability lens)
- RAA-Core (formal definitions, equations, diagrams)
